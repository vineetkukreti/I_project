Since war broke out in Donbas, eastern Ukraine in 2014, the city of Moringa, which was home to around 10,000 people, has been contested by Ukrainian forces and Russian-backed paramilitaries. Now, following Russia's full invasion of Ukraine last year, Moringa, like many other cities, has been all but destroyed; it has essentially been wiped off the map. In the past seven years, about 700,000 people have been displaced in the region.
